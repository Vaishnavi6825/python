The provided Python code utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple digital clock GUI. The clock displays the current time in the format "HH:MM:SS AM/PM" and updates every second. The graphical interface includes a large label with a custom font ("ds-digital") and a color scheme of black background and yellow foreground. The time function retrieves the current time using the strftime method and updates the label accordingly. The code employs recursion and the after method to refresh the clock display every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). The script is encapsulated in a Tkinter window titled "Clock," and it continuously runs within the main event loop (mainloop()).
